# 🚀 IT Geeks Club - Collaborative Portfolio Workshop

Welcome to the Git & GitHub Masterclass Workshop.

In this project, you will work as a team of 4 to build the official landing page for the "IT Geeks Club".

## 🎯 The Mission

The club needs a new website. The Lead Developer (Instructor) has built the skeleton, but the content is missing! Your team must split the work, work in parallel using branches, and merge your code using Pull Requests.

## 📂 Folder Structure

## 👥 Team Assignments

Decide who is Member 1, 2, 3, and 4.

| Role | Branch Name | Section to Edit | Responsibility |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Member 1 | feature-hero | Hero Section | Change Headline, Slogan, and Button text. |
| Member 2 | feature-about | About Section | Write club description, update stats numbers. |
| Member 3 | feature-activities | Activities | Rename cards to real workshop topics (e.g., Python, UI/UX). |
| Member 4 | feature-team | Team Section | Add names and roles for 4 board members. |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup (Everyone)

Fork this repository (One person forks, invites others as Collaborators, OR everyone forks individually).

Clone to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItgeeksFSTT/GIT-GITHUB-WORKSHOP
cd GIT-GITHUB-WORKSHOP
```

### Phase 2: Create Your Workspace (Everyone)

Do not work on main! Create your specific branch.

```bash
# Example for Member 1
git checkout -b branch-name
```

### Phase 3: Code & Commit (Everyone)

1. Open `index.html` in VS Code.
2. Find your comment block (e.g., `<!-- MEMBER 1 AREA -->`).
3. Change the text, add divs, or change classes.
4. Save the file.
5. Stage and Commit:

```bash
git status
git add index.html
git commit -m "commit-name"
```

### Phase 4: Push & Pull Request (Everyone)

Push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
# Example for Member 1
git push -u origin feature-hero
```

Go to GitHub. You will see a yellow box: "Compare & pull request". Click it.

- **Title**: "Finished Hero Section"
- **Description**: "Added new headline and button."
- Click **Create Pull Request**.

### Phase 5: Review & Merge (Team)

1. Go to the **Pull Requests** tab.
2. Open a teammate's PR.
3. Go to **Files changed**. Review their code.
4. Click **Review changes** -> **Approve**.
5. (If you have permission) Click **Merge Pull Request**.

## ⚔️ Dealing with Conflicts (The Fun Part)

If two members edited the exact same line, GitHub will block the merge.

Pull the latest main into your branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-hero
git pull origin main
```

VS Code will show the conflict.

Choose "Accept Incoming" or "Accept Current" or fix manually.

Commit the fix and push again.

## ✅ Final Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] All 4 branches created correctly (feature-xyz).
- [ ] All 4 Pull Requests created.
- [ ] At least 1 PR reviewed by a teammate.
- [ ] All PRs merged into main.
- [ ] Website opens locally with all sections complete.
